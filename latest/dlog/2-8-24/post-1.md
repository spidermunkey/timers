I should probably pick up some kind of design system. Not just in code but actual tools and applications.... It would make the whole rough drafting much easier.

I hesitant because 1 I need a powerful enough machine to handle such applications like figma illustrator photoshop etc, but also because I like the idea of a daily github commit.

I'll get the machine but I must remember that the mission is 1 commit per day, and since the It's my 30th birthday I should really bump that up to 30lines of code a day for the remainder of the year.

I also need to remember that the goal isn't project specific but finishing goals and completing task is the over-arching assignment.

I'm really just overthinking it.
And over complicating everything trying to do things I haven't learned yet.
