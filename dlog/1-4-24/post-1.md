Last year I worked 2 jobs for the last 7 months of the year. Still commited to projects I would find blocks of time to code, I only had about 5days off in that time period however if I had atleast 4hours of time for any day that I didn't need to work or sleep I dedicated that block to coding.

I wanted to commit to writing code every day however, my level of proficiency required me to spend some of those blocks to study.

I now feel like I'm able to write code everyday and even though I'm still working 2 jobs and working everyday at that I think I can put in atleast an hour a day either before or after work.

Let's see how this goes.
