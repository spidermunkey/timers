currently, I'm not using react, svelte, php, or dsls because I don't know them.

I don't know them because I've been trying to learn how things work as before adding any abstractions that I don't understand.

version 0.1 is will be js, html, sass, node, mongodb... that's it.

In later versions, as I learn how to utilize tools I'll begin refactoring with them but for now I feel very fluent with the barebones stack.

I want this project done today so I can use it and move on to creating more productivity tools.

Once I feel satisfied I'll add bells and whistles.
