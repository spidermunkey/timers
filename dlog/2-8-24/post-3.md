I'm really just overthinking it.

And over complicating everything trying to do things I haven't learned yet.

The actual timer app was pretty much built, although not pretty.
Should've just kept going with the same version, adding features without much styling until I could call it finished enough to use.

v2 looks nice and all but it doesn't work and I've missed out 2 weeks of using the app trying to style features that don't exist.
