Did I mention I got a new pc? Yea well a month back I bought a custom pc, tried to dual boot linux,
and after serval backup hours, partitions, and installations it just went out. I think I screwed up the motherboard.
ubuntu 22 didn't work with my graphics card or mobo (i think) so the buttons on the gui didn't work.
this was after I wiped the main windows operating system from the hardrive. tried to install windows from linux on a separate machine
(very sketchy process). But it wouldn't read it, no os found. tried to flash back the bios but go no post, no display, no nothing.
After weeks of toil I bout new parts, mobo, and os and the only new part that worked (via part-swap) was the mobo.

So I'm back from my new pc pretty much brand new from the case, and I'll just stick to wsl and powershell for now.
