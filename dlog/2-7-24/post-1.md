I've noticed that whenever there is a feature or functionality that I want to impliment, but don't know exactly how, I tend to stall, procastinate and bounce ideas in my head and none of them work. I wrestle with the idea that the project is stalling because I don't know how I want the design to look, which may be true, but I know believe I don't know how I want the design to look because I've never made the feature and I have know clue how it'll actually turn out. The thought alone scares me, into procastination. Dancing around an intimating feature is the problem. I should just attack the feature head on, in small bites, modular peices that just work until I can assemble the in the actual project. When I do this the project picks up progress again but it takes effort, and that effort I know I need to put in is stalling the process.

get on with it. build the thing. too big? build bytes. just get on with it.

the waters always scariest before you sail but staying on the shore kinda sucks...
