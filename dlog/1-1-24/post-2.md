I do have some basic utility functions and classes that i'll bring in.
I wish I knew a more succinct way to use them but I've just been copy and pasting them. Maybe I need to create a package.
I have the mojo repository but I don't yet understand how to
    1) clone the local one and push to github under the same name
    2) bring it into a current project with all its dependecies

To bring my utilities in a project I've been using one large file for utility functions,
another for classes, once more for global project specific variables.
I attach those as scripts in the head tag so they are available throughout the project modules. It works but it feels sloppy
