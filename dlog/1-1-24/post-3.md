It works, I just need to link the form to create timers on the fly, then add some crud funcitionality to my existing api and I can rest for the day.

It's error prone and inefficient but it works... and I would've given up or spent weeks studying just to get this simple boiler code up and running.

I'm also working with git/github fairly comfortably for the first time ever.

I'll take it as a win.
