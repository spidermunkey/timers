This works, that works, it all kinda works or could work but I think alot of it can and should be abstracted into composable functions and classes that.

I hate when this happens because this is the point when I want to start building or adding to a library of such functions but I also want to see the project through at my current capabliities and toolset. So do I stop and start, swap and shape, or keep powering through and start when I'm done with my tasks.

I think I should build the library, I have time to learn, time to practice, so I think I should build the thing that makes all the future things easier.

Most of my classes in the utils folder are ment to be apart of a bigger library but some are primarily dom focused while others are primarily functionality focused and some are a mixed bunch. There has to be a way to organize them.
