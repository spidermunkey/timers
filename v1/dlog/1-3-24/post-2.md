Like I said, it's hacky but I got it done today!
Data integrity is a problem, archecture both front-end and back-end need refactoring.
I can create and read (barely),
but the update & delete can only but done from the db website...

The whole project smells but I'd say to get something working in one day is a milestone for me.

All checkboxes checked time for sleep.
