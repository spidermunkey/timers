# timers
for daily goals

## Organizing my life

Life is hard, sometimes when it sucks, I have a tendency to regress.
In my youth I turned to drugs.
As I grew older I turned inside, anxious to be alone.
Then I began to turn to outside sources and influences.
I've come to believe that if I am to persist I must turn to daily habits.
